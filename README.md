#CSSmileys
*A super simple CSS class for making your smileys more fun.*

`cssmileys.css` is a stylesheet that includes a single class, `.smiley`, that will make common emoticons more colorful. You can see an example at: `http://cssmileys.andrewgomez.info`. 

The class works decently well at common sizes on modern browsers for: :), :(, :|, :P, ;), ;P, and :'(.

Feel free to suggest improvements! This was mostly a project to help me learn about the new CSS3 psuedo-elements.

##Usage
To use cssmileys.css in your website, simply include the stylesheet in your webpage's `<head>`, add the following class to your emoticons.

For example, instead of the following text:
```
Hello :). How are you?
```

Include the following:
```
Hello <span class="smiley">:)</span>. How are you?
```

There are no images whatsoever, so the emoticon should look great at (almost) any size!
